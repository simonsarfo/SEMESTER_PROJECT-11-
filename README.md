Stock Management System;
The Stock Management System in C++ is a program designed to help businesses
manage their stock levels. It tracks the current inventory of products and allows
users to add, delete and modify items in the inventory. Technologies used in this
project include C++ and SQLite. SQLite is used to store and manage data. C++ is
used for the programâ€™s backend, allowing for the stock management system to be
easily modified and extended. The Stock Management System is a powerful tool
that can help store owners and managers keep track of their stock, allowing them
to make the most of their resources.
